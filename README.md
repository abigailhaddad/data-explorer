Here’s your updated README — cleaned up, slightly polished, and with all mention of `requirements.txt` removed:
# Data Explorer

**Data Explorer** is a lightweight, browser-based interface for exploring structured data. There’s no backend, no build process, and no dependencies — just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Drop in your dataset and a matching configuration, and it renders a fully interactive table with filters, search, statistics, and CSV export.

You can use this for quick internal dashboards, dataset previews, or lightweight tools for sharing data with others. Everything runs entirely in the browser.

---

## Getting Started

To run the app, just open `index.html` in your browser.

If you'd rather serve it locally (to avoid browser restrictions on file loading), you can use a Python HTTP server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

## How It Works

When the page loads, it pulls in two files:

* `data.json`: your dataset, formatted as an array of objects.
* `config.js`: a configuration file that defines which fields to show, how to format them, and what filters or stats to include.

Based on that, the app builds:

* A filterable, sortable data table with column visibility controls
* A set of filters (select menus or free-text) based on your config
* A top section showing summary statistics (like total records, active users, etc.)
* Export to CSV for the current filtered view

All of this is handled client-side — no JavaScript changes are needed to support a new dataset, as long as the structure is reflected in the config.

---

## Customization

You can adapt the interface for your data:

* **Swap the data:**
  Replace `data.json` with your own. Just make sure it’s an array of objects with consistent keys.

* **Adjust the config:**
  In `config.js`, you define how each field should behave — its label, visibility, formatting (like currency or date), and how it supports filtering.

* **Tweak the design:**
  The styling is defined in `style.css`, which builds on Bootstrap 5 and includes a custom theme. You can change colors, spacing, fonts, or layout to better suit your organization or project.

The JavaScript in `app.js` is generic and driven by the config, so you rarely need to modify it unless you’re adding entirely new behavior.

---

## Deployment

Because it’s all static files, you can host this anywhere — GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, S3, or even on a shared drive.

To deploy, make sure you include:

* `index.html`
* `app.js`
* `config.js`
* `data.json`
* `style.css`

All files should live in the same directory for everything to load correctly.

---

## Notes

* The dataset (`data.json`) and configuration (`config.js`) must be in the same folder as `index.html`.
* Filtering is done entirely in the browser, so performance may drop with very large datasets (10k+ rows).
* If you'd prefer to pull data from an API or remote source, you can modify the `fetch()` call in `app.js`.

## Use Cases

Data Explorer is useful for:

* Quickly exploring a dataset without building a full app
* Making lightweight, shareable dashboards
* Prototyping with real data
* Giving non-technical users a way to interact with structured information
